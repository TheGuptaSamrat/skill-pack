## DETAILED ROUTING DECISIONS

### 1. QUALITY vs. RECONCILIATION (Most Common Confusion)

#### Quality (Structural Data Conformance)
**Question:** "Does data match the schema?"

**Use QUALITY for:**
- ✅ Field null-checks (NOT NULL constraint violations)
- ✅ Domain validation (field value in allowed enum)
- ✅ Type validation (numeric field contains non-numbers)
- ✅ Key constraints (primary/unique key violations)
- ✅ Single-table or simple cohort rules
- ✅ Null handling defaults
- ✅ Reference type definitions

**Examples:**
```
"GL_ACCOUNT must not be null" → Quality
"ASSET_CLASS must be in ('010','020','030')" → Quality
"VENDOR_ID must exist in VENDOR table" → Quality (FK check)
"Amount must be numeric(13,2)" → Quality
```

**Output:** SQL quality rule definitions, domain enumerations, validation checklists

#### Reconciliation (Business Data Verification)
**Question:** "Do the totals and records balance?"

**Use RECONCILIATION for:**
- ✅ Cross-process totals balancing
- ✅ Row count verification across systems
- ✅ Control totals before/after
- ✅ Data-flow validation (counts from source → staging → target)
- ✅ Process-run verification (did this job succeed?)
- ✅ Key integrity across joined tables
- ✅ Multi-table or multi-process validation

**Examples:**
```
"Source rows 10,000 vs Target rows 9,999?" → Reconciliation
"SUM(Amount) before = SUM(Amount) after?" → Reconciliation
"CVPM job completed successfully?" → Reconciliation
"FK integrity across HFPPD and HKTVR?" → Reconciliation (if cross-process)
```

**Output:** SQL reconciliation queries, process validation checkpoints, error resolution

#### Decision Tree: Quality vs Reconciliation
```
Question: I need to validate data. Which skill?

├─ Is validation at SINGLE TABLE level?
│  ├─ YES (validate fields within one table)
│  │  └─ → USE QUALITY
│  └─ NO (validate across multiple tables/processes)
│     └─ NEXT
│
├─ Are we checking TOTALS or ROW COUNTS?
│  ├─ YES (balancing numbers, counts, control totals)
│  │  └─ → USE RECONCILIATION
│  └─ NO (checking data types, domains, nulls)
│     └─ → USE QUALITY
│
├─ Is this a PRE-DEPLOYMENT or ONGOING check?
│  ├─ PRE-DEPLOYMENT (once per environment setup)
│  │  └─ → USE QUALITY (rule definitions)
│  └─ ONGOING (every process run or daily)
│     └─ → USE RECONCILIATION (monitoring queries)
```

### 2. CONFIG vs. CVPM (Process Setup)

#### Config (Customizing Configuration)
**Question:** "How do I set up this SAP feature?"

**Use CONFIG for:**
- ✅ IMG paths and customizing sequences
- ✅ Business Content installation (BC sets)
- ✅ Table configuration (Method Master, Process Type Master)
- ✅ System parameters and defaults
- ✅ User profile assignments
- ✅ Installation checklists
- ✅ Pre/post-installation tasks

**Examples:**
```
"Where do I define CVPM Process Types?" → Config
"How do I install FPSL Business Content?" → Config
"What's the IMG path for GL account determination?" → Config
"Checklist: What to verify after installation?" → Config
```

**Output:** Setup guidance, IMG paths, configuration checklists, transaction codes

#### CVPM (Process Design & Implementation)
**Question:** "How should I design this specific process?"

**Use CVPM for:**
- ✅ CVPM job structure and threading
- ✅ Calculation method design (AMDP, SQL, rules)
- ✅ Worklist integration
- ✅ Process-step sequencing
- ✅ Operational run verification
- ✅ Periodic task strategy
- ✅ CVPM-specific monitoring

**Examples:**
```
"Design a multi-threaded CVPM job for valuations" → CVPM
"Map valuation methods to FPSL process steps" → CVPM
"How should periodic tasks integrate with CVPM?" → CVPM
"CVPM Monitor setup and troubleshooting" → CVPM
```

**Output:** CVPM design document, method mapping, threading guidance, job structure

#### Decision Tree: Config vs CVPM
```
Question: I'm doing FPSL configuration. Which skill?

├─ Am I setting up SAP customizing (IMG)?
│  ├─ YES (installing, configuring parameters, setting up users)
│  │  └─ → USE CONFIG
│  └─ NO (designing specific process flow)
│     └─ NEXT
│
├─ Is this specific to CVPM job design?
│  ├─ YES (job structure, method mapping, threading)
│  │  └─ → USE CVPM
│  └─ NO (general FPSL setup)
│     └─ → USE CONFIG
│
├─ Will I write code or design architecture?
│  ├─ YES (AMDP, SQL, class design)
│  │  └─ → USE CVPM (for design) then AMDP/ABAP (for code)
│  └─ NO (just configuration)
│     └─ → USE CONFIG
```

---

### 3. MAPPING vs. DOCS (Understanding)

#### Mapping (Source-to-Target Specifications)
**Question:** "How does data flow from source → target?"

**Use MAPPING for:**
- ✅ Field-level source-to-target transformations
- ✅ Join conditions and cardinality
- ✅ Lookup tables and code translations
- ✅ Derivation/calculation logic
- ✅ Mapping specifications (confirmed/inferred/unresolved)
- ✅ Data quality rules for mappings
- ✅ Implementation handoff notes

**Examples:**
```
"PO_NUMBER in source maps to DEAL_ID in target (1:1 join on ORDER_ID)" → Mapping
"LEDGER_CODE translates via lookup table ZZ_LEDGER_XREF" → Mapping
"IF PRODUCT_TYPE='BOND' THEN ASSET_CLASS='020'" → Mapping
```

**Output:** Mapping specification (CSV, YAML, or markdown), validation queries

#### Docs (Technical Documentation)
**Question:** "How does this system work at a high level?"

**Use DOCS for:**
- ✅ System architecture and data model overview
- ✅ Process step descriptions
- ✅ Deployment topology
- ✅ Data-flow diagrams (conceptual)
- ✅ Module relationships
- ✅ Glossary and terminology
- ✅ General technical handoff documentation

**Examples:**
```
"Explain FPSL architecture and Universal Journal" → Docs
"How do FPSL process steps relate?" → Docs
"What's the deployment model (embedded vs hub)?" → Docs
"Define: Deal, Security, Portfolio, Account" → Docs
```

**Output:** Technical documentation, architecture documentation, glossary

#### Decision Tree: Mapping vs Docs
```
Question: I need documentation. Which skill?

├─ Is this about HOW DATA FLOWS in a specific transformation?
│  ├─ YES (field-level, join conditions, lookups)
│  │  └─ → USE MAPPING
│  └─ NO (broader architectural question)
│     └─ NEXT
│
├─ Am I creating a MAPPING SPEC for implementation?
│  ├─ YES (will be handed to engineer for coding)
│  │  └─ → USE MAPPING
│  └─ NO (explaining or understanding)
│     └─ → USE DOCS
│
├─ Will this output be used by DEVELOPERS?
│  ├─ YES (in ADT, for coding)
│  │  └─ → USE MAPPING
│  └─ NO (for understanding)
│     └─ → USE DOCS
```

- ✅ Orchestration (sequential steps, error handling)
- ✅ ABAP OO classes and interfaces
- ✅ Wrapper design for AMDP
- ✅ Batch processing and job control
- ✅ ABAP Unit tests
- ✅ Validations and exception handling

**Examples:**
```
"Orchestrate: Load → Transform → Validate → Load" → ABAP
"Design ABAP class to call AMDP method" → ABAP
"Write ABAP Unit test for this workflow" → ABAP
"Handle errors and retries" → ABAP
```

#### AMDP (SQLScript, Pushdown, Performance)
**Use AMDP for:**
- ✅ SQLScript implementations
- ✅ HANA pushdown processing
- ✅ CDS table functions
